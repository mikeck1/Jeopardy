// Rules of the game.
// There are 3 teams playing: Team 1, Team 2, Team 3.
// The game starts in notStarted state.
//
// When teams Team 1, Team 2, and Team 3 are added, and startGame() is called,
// Game moves into choosingQuestion state with Team 1 picking first.
//
// e.g. Scenario 1:
// Team 1 picked a question with 100 points
// Team 1 gets to answer first and answers correctly.
// Team 1's score increases by 100 and Team 2 gets to pick a question next (because Team 1 picked the last question).
//
// e.g. Scenario 2:
// Team 2 picked a question with 100 points
// Team 2 gets to answer first and answers incorrectly.
// Team 3 attempts next, and answers correctly.
// Team 3's score increases by 100 and Team 3 gets to pick the next question (because Team 2 picked the last question).
//
// e.g. Scenario 3:
// Team 3 picked a question with 100 points
// Team 3 gets to answer first and answers incorrectly.
// Team 1 attempts next, and answers incorrectly.
// Team 2 attempts next, and answers incorrectly.
// No one scores. Team 1 gets to pick a question next (because Team 3 picked the last question).
//
// Eventually, when all questions are asked, the game goes into gameOver state.
